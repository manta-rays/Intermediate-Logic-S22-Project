Files to implement:
1. Logic sentences
- boolean equivalences
- binary operators
- unary operators
- expressed by expressoin tree 

2. Expression tree Class
- made up of smaller expression trees
- nodes 

3. Node Class (Nodes of expression tree)
- operator object
- expression
- parent 
- list of children


4. Operator Class
- symbol
- dimension
- can read from json file

5. Puzzle Class
- every puzzle object has a list of expressions
- 


Steps for solving:
1. take in all statements
2. make into tree 
3. simplify each one 
- find subtree equivalence in boolean logic 
- simplify
4. Proof by Contradiction
- assume every sentence
- 



Other things:
- require users for parenthesis 
- template
